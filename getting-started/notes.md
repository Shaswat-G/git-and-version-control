Q. Why we need a version control system?
A. Tracking changes in project files overtime (time-stamped history) and collaborating with others (merging work and resolving conflicts).

Q. 2 types of Version control system?
A. Central (single point of failure like subversion and team foundation server, have to wait till it comes online) vs Distributed (everyone has a copy, like git and mercurial, snapshots are locally stored, and can be sync with each other on a network)

Q. Git usage?
A. CLI vs GUI (GitKraken - crossplatform and beautiful, sourcetree) vs IDE based (extensions in VS code like GitLens).
GUIs always have limitations - there is only so much you can do with buttons, scroll bards, graphs, etc. CLI allows fine-grained customized control.
Since everything is ultimately based on CLI learning CLI is much better for developing conceptual clarity and then you can use these concepts for using GUI tools
that others in your team / project / company use.
